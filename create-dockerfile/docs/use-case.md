# Usecase

When is necessary create a simple docker image with just some packages inside (eg. curl, psql, ...).

> I need an alpine linux with curl or 7z

When you need a base image with a package of python.

> My code run with python 3.7 but I need the mysql packages inside it.

In another words when you need a helper image to run at another place, like CI/CD jobs.
